# License-plate



With the increase in the number of vehicles, vehicle tracking has become an important research area for efficient traffic control, surveillance, and finding stolen cars. For this purpose, efficient real-time license plate detection and recognition are of great importance. Due to the variation in the background and font color, font style, size of the license plate, and non-standard characters, license plate recognition is a great challenge in developing countries. To overcome such issues, this study applies a deep-learning strategy to improve license plate recognition efficiency. The collected images have been captured under various lighting/contrast conditions, distance from the camera, varying angle of rotation, and validated to produce a high recognition rate. The approach can be effectively used by law enforcement agencies and private organizations to improve homeland security. Future work may include training and validation of the existing algorithm using the hybrid classifier method and improvement of the robustness of the license plate recognition system in varying weather conditions.
